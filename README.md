### Automatic Posting to GitHub

When you create a new report, a pane will appear below the editor that enables posting your report as a GitHub Issue.

![Bug Report Post Form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lee-dohm/bug-report/master/images/form.gif)

For the Bug Report package to post on your behalf, you need to supply a GitHub API token. You may obtain one by [following the instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) on GitHub. Your token will need at least the `repo` or `public repo` permission for posting to work.

Instructions:

1. Enter a title for the issue.
1. Specify the repository to post the Issue against as `user/reponame`.
    * This can be found in the URL for the repo, for example `https://github.com/lee-dohm/bug-report` would be `lee-dohm/bug-report`.
    * The default repository is for the core Atom editor at `atom/atom`. Only post there if you have checked that the problem isn't in a user-supplied package. Do this by running Atom in safe mode with `atom --safe`.
1. Enter your GitHub API token.
    * By default, this token is saved for future sessions. See the [Configuration](#configuration) section for more information.
1. Click `Post Issue`. It should only take a few seconds for Bug Report to post the Issue, after which the panel will show you a link to it.

Once you have posted you will not be able to post this same report again. If you wish, you may copy this report and open a new one to start over.

## Configuration

![Bug Report Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lee-dohm/bug-report/master/images/configuration.png)

* `bug-report.saveToken`
    * `true` &mdash; Saves the token in the file specified by `tokenPath`
    * `false` &mdash; Does not save the token. It will need to be entered each time a report is posted on your behalf.
* `bug-report.tokenPath` &mdash; Path at which the API token will be saved if `saveToken` is enabled.

### Commands

* `bug-report:open` &mdash; Opens the bug report template with version information already included

### Keybinding

* `ctrl-shift-alt-b` &mdash; Executes `bug-report:open`
